\begin{abstract}

This report explores the possibility of using a Linux distribution for a relatively small embedded computer system. A simple game of Pong has been created as demonstration for this project. An interrupt based Linux device driver has been implemented for the game pad that controls the game. The report further investigates the energy aspects of using Linux on an embedded platform. The results clearly show that using such a complex system takes away some flexibility in regards of tailoring an applications to meet a specific need. An average current consumption of 12 mA was achieved.
